🧠 Memory Management Simulator (Linked List Project)

A Python-based Memory Management Simulator that demonstrates how operating systems manage memory dynamically using a linked list data structure. This project is designed for Data Structures & Algorithms coursework and academic learning.

📌 Project Overview

The Memory Management Simulator models dynamic memory allocation and deallocation similar to an operating system. Each memory block is represented as a linked list node, allowing efficient tracking of allocated and free memory blocks.

The simulator helps users understand:

How memory is allocated to processes

How memory is freed and reused

How fragmentation is handled by merging free blocks

✨ Features

Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation

Merging of adjacent free memory blocks

Handles invalid input and memory overflow

Interactive console-based interface

Real-time display of memory layout

🧩 Data Structure Used

Each memory block is implemented as a Linked List Node containing:

Start address

Block size

Process name

Status (Free / Allocated)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Data Structures & Algorithms

Linked List

📂 Documentation

This project includes a complete Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document containing:

Functional & non-functional requirements

Use Case Diagram

Flowchart (Memory Allocation & Deallocation)

▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed, then run:

python memory_simulator.py

🖥️ Sample Output

The simulator displays the current memory layout after each operation.

[Start Address]  [Size]  [Process]  [Status]
