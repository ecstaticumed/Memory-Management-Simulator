# 🧠 Memory Management Simulator (Linked List Project)

A **Python-based Memory Management Simulator** that demonstrates how operating systems manage memory dynamically using a **linked list data structure**. This project is designed for **Data Structures & Algorithms** coursework and academic learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Memory Management Simulator models **dynamic memory allocation and deallocation** similar to an operating system. Each memory block is represented as a **linked list node**, allowing efficient tracking of allocated and free memory blocks.

The simulator helps users understand:
- How memory is allocated to processes
- How memory is freed and reused
- How fragmentation is handled by merging free blocks

---

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation  
- Merging of adjacent free memory blocks  
- Handles invalid input and memory overflow  
- Interactive **console-based interface**  
- Real-time display of memory layout  

---

## 🧩 Data Structure Used

Each memory block is implemented as a **Linked List Node** containing:

- Start address  
- Block size  
- Process name  
- Status (Free / Allocated)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**
  - Linked List  

---

## 📂 Documentation

This project includes a complete **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document containing:

- Functional & non-functional requirements  
- Use Case Diagram  
- Flowchart (Memory Allocation & Deallocation)  
- Object Diagram  
- Class Diagram

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed, then run:

```bash
python memory_simulator.py
```
🖥️ Sample Output
```
The simulator displays the current memory layout after each operation.
[Start Address]  [Size]  [Process]  [Status]
